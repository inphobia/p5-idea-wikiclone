Camelcade supports [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us/) templates. At the moment on the very basic level:

* Parsing templates
* Create Mojolicious template file action
* Basic auto-completion of default helpers and tag helpers
* Here-doc injection in perl code with MOJO marker
* Files navigation in include helper (been done not for Mojo, but pretty handy here)
