If you would like to report a bug, please, conform the following policy:

The bug is when something was claimed to work and it doesn't or work incorrectly.
Missing functional requires not a bug report, but feature request.

1. Check that [there is no opened issue](https://github.com/hurricup/Perl5-IDEA/issues) about the same bug. If there is, you may 
comment in there if you have something to add.
2. Describe what is wrong in details, you'll need to do it anyway if we won't be able to understand you. If this bug report is about incorrectly working Perl feature, please, specify a link to the documentation, describing proper behavior, http://perldoc.perl.org is perfect for that. The more information you provide, the faster we can locate and fix the bug.
3. Describe steps to reproduce a bug.
4. Your bug may be platform-related, so specify your OS name and version, Java version and your JetBrains product name and version.
5. You should try to reproduce a bug with other plugins disabled, because it may be a conflict, not plugin's bug itself.
6. We will decide how urgent this bug is and may release a hotfix for current version or fix it in the one of the next releases.
