Welcome to the Camelcade wiki.

Camelcade is a Perl5 plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. This project been created for making my own work on Perl5 projects easier, so it has some strange (on the first look) features, like embedded Perl5 support. But I'll be glad if it will help someone else.

Perl5 is really syntax-flexible, what can be really convenient in one-line programs, but often unnecessary in large projects. 

I think, It's not possible to create 100% proper Perl5 lexer/parser without 100% repeating Perl5 respective sources, but we can try to do our best.
