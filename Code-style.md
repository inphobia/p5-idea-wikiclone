To make your life easier in Camelcade, try to avoid ambiguous constructions whenever it's possible and not really expensive. For example, use `m/regex/` syntax instead of just `/regex/`. More strict syntax will improve plugin performance and save you from unnecessary problems. You may find list of knwon syntax nuances [here](https://github.com/hurricup/Perl5-IDEA/wiki/Camelcade-Perl-syntax-nuances).
